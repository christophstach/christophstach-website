          I started software development at the age of 13. It quickly became a passion for me and I started to code my
          first small projects and websites. I found most interest in websites. These days they were still developed
          with HTML frame sets and some very basic <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> scripts.

          I kept doing <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and also used it in some internships I did. After
          finishing an IT specialized business school and doing a German apprenticeship, I started my first job as
          TYPO3-developer (a popular PHP-based CMS-system). I even published some small extensions on the TYPO3
          extension gallery. Later on, I switched job to a more generalized <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>{' '}
          full-stack engineer. After working multiple years, I decided to quit and go traveling for a while. Then when
          coming back to Germany, I moved to Berlin where I started to studying at{' '}
          <a href="https://www.htw-berlin.de/">HTW Berlin</a>, a little later I started working as a frontend engineer
          in part-time. During my studies, I also found interest in developing methods of artificial intelligence with
          neural networks. Later I focused more on methods of bioinformatics, studying the creation of pipelines for
          next generation sequencing data. I always kept up to date with developing websites. My main interest is the
          frontend part. I used many frameworks like <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>,{' '}
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a>,{' '}
          <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> (especially SvelteKit) and{' '}
          <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>. Recently, <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>{' '}
          caught my attention and I also create this website with it.
